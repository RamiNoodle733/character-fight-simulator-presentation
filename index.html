            iOS Shortcuts are typically used for small, everyday tasks like playing the most recent album, retrieving location data from an image, or quickly accessing a specific app. However, I wanted to push the boundaries of what’s possible within the iOS Shortcuts framework. The Character Fight Simulator is an ambitious project that transforms this simple automation tool into a dynamic, interactive program. It generates fight animations between any two user-selected characters over a chosen background, all without using any input files. Instead, it retrieves all relevant images and quotes from the web in real-time, and includes features such as randomized attack power and order, various effects, character quotes, and a winner determined by healthbar depletion. This project demonstrates how iOS Shortcuts can be utilized not just for minor tasks, but for creating complex, entertaining experiences.

            <h3>Best Examples</h3>
            <p>Here are some of the most memorable moments generated by the Character Fight Simulator. Each animation was created simply by inputting any two character names and a background name of the user's choice, all through an iOS shortcut. The real magic happens when the quotes align perfectly, making it seem as though the characters are actually interacting. Those moments, where the dialogue feels almost too perfect, never fail to be hilarious. Enjoy these highlights!</p>

                <p>This fight stands out to me, perhaps because of how well the colors blend together. What really makes it memorable, though, are the quotes. Knowing that the quotes are pulled directly from the web for each specific "character" adds a layer of humor. When a character like "Animated Dragon," for example, delivers such a quote, it’s so funny to me.</p>

                <p>This GIF captures a recent Batman vs. Superman showdown, showcasing the evolution of the Character Fight Simulator. After switching the image source from Google to Dogpile, the visuals improved significantly, allowing for less specific but higher-quality results. This fight stands in stark contrast to the earlier Batman vs. Superman matchups that I initially used to test the shortcut, highlighting just how much the simulator has advanced.

                <p>DORA SLID FOR BOOTS! This fight is so funny to me. I was running the shortcut with my friend and his little brother when, out of nowhere, Dora appeared like a tag team partner in a fighting game, sliding in to save Boots. The unexpectedness of it all made the moment absolutely hilarious.</p>
